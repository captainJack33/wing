Hi Rob,

I have been playing with GDELT and examples shared on their site. 

I see below issues:
1. Data comes from google cloud database (bigquery), issue is to query it takes 
few minutes. 
2. Data is available free for only few GBS, which I have exceeded in only few 
queries. We have to get paid service to unlimited data.

There are few more technical issues. 

But we can fix above issues.  

Question we want answer is:

Does GDELT single source information that solves our use case. 
If yes, then we can concentrate on fixing about issues. 

If GDELT is not comprehensive, then we have to use other sources. 

Pl let me know your thoughts. 

Best,
Gopi.
